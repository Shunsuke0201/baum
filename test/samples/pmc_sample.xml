Most conventional methods, including carrier-mediated transfer (Felgner et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1987</xref>) and electroporation, aim to transfect an entire cell population, while target cell transfection has typically been achieved using glass pipettes to microinject (Graessmann et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1974</xref>). Recently, new methods of transfecting individual cells have been developed with the help of advanced technologies, such as femtosecond lasers (Stevenson et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>), atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes (Cuerrier et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2007</xref>), and carbon nanotubes (Chen et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>; Han et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005</xref>). Transfection of individual live cultured cells at high spatial resolution has been achieved using AFM with an ultrathin needle sharpened to a diameter of 200&#x02013;300&#x000a0;nm by focused ion beam etching (Tseng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>). The AFM tip was decorated with DNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and was inserted into cells and held there for some time, resulting in accumulation of GFP fluorescence in the treated cells (Obataya et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2005</xref>). Repeated insertion of DNA-decorated AFM probes into cultured cells resulted in a transfection rate of 30% (Cuerrier et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe a simple, efficient, and gentle method for molecular delivery into cultured cells. We have developed a device with an ultrathin needle that can be attached to any inverted microscope. To simplify the procedure, interactions between the tip end and the cell membrane are not monitored, and molecules for delivery are added to the culture medium. Using a three-dimensional stage controller, as many as 100 cells can be transfected within 10&#x000a0;min. DNA and chemical (Rhodamine101) delivery into HeLa cells was achieved with high success rates (75% and 100%, respectively), and DNA was transfected into cultured neurons without causing any damage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To improve the means of molecular delivery into individual cells, we developed an apparatus called a CellBee that can be attached to an inverted microscope (IX81, Olympus) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). A silicon needle composed of a tip and a lever is attached to a motor-controlled <italic>z</italic>-stage (LAS20-025-52S, SMAC JAPAN) via an anchor and a holder (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). This apparatus is attached to the condenser component of the inverted microscope so that the tip is oriented vertically (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C, D). The needle can be mobilized along the <italic>z</italic>-axis with a resolution of 0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. Cells cultured on a coverslip are set on a stage, and the medium is replaced with Hank&#x02019;s solution supplemented with the molecules to be delivered. Cell morphology is monitored by phase contrast (PC) or differential interference contrast (DIC). The 488-nm beam from an Ar<sup>+</sup> laser is introduced through the objective, and the reflected light that passes through a pinhole is detected using a photomultiplier tube (PMT). This laser-scanning confocal microscopy can determine the <italic>z</italic>-position of the tip end (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A) and the bottom of the coverslip (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B).

This technique does not monitor interactions between the tip and cell membrane, whereas previously reported techniques using AFM probes measured force-distance curves (Cuerrier et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2007</xref>). Once the <italic>z</italic>-positions of the tip and coverslip are registered, it is possible to perform delivery in a programmed fashion. Therefore, the CellBee is best used in combination with an <italic>x</italic>&#x02013;<italic>y</italic> stage controller for pinpoint delivery to multiple cells with high accuracy and speed by selecting cells using a PC image and then automatically and sequentially injecting cells. Homemade software coordinates the image acquisition and stage control. The coverslip is placed on a motor-controlled <italic>x</italic>&#x02013;<italic>y</italic> stage (BIOS-212T, SIGMAKOKI), and an image of the cells on the coverslip is taken by a CCD camera (ORCA-ER, HAMAMATSU) and displayed on a screen. The position of each cell is defined by its <italic>x</italic>&#x02013;<italic>y</italic> coordinates.</p><p>To develop a suitable needle, conventional AFM cantilevers made of silicon were first tested. We noticed that the flexibility of the needle was critical, with a very flexible cantilever failing to penetrate cell membranes, and a rigid cantilever breaking easily when its tip touched the surface of the coverslip. Thus, we chose a cantilever with moderate flexibility (AC160BN, Olympus). As revealed by an SEM image (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A), the tip of the AC160BN needle was not extremely fine. To avoid possible cell damage caused by insertion of such a dull tip, we shaved the AC160BN using focused ion beam (FIB) technology. The sharpened cantilever (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B) was given the name &#x0201c;NanoBlade.&#x0201d; Assuming that the tips of AC160BN and the NanoBlade pierced into round cells, we calculated the area of the puncture of the plasma membrane (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A) and the volume of the cell displaced with the tip (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B) based on SEM images (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). While both the area and volume increased with the insertion depth, an almost linear relationship was calculated for the NanoBlade, whereas a supralinear relationship was determined for the AC160BN needle. This suggests that the NanoBlade causes much less cell damage than an AC160BN needle.

Thus, we performed stabbing of HeLa cells in the presence of Rhodamine101 (20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml) in the medium. One hundred and five cells were selected on a PC image (a part of the image is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A), and cells were stabbed sequentially with the CellBee <italic>z</italic>-stage and the <italic>x</italic>&#x02013;<italic>y</italic> stage controllers fully active. The whole process took only 10&#x000a0;min. Immediately after washing with normal medium, we observed that all of the stabbed cells showed a detectable amount of red fluorescence (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), although the fluorescence intensity varied from cell to cell. A fluorescence image corresponding to the PC image (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A) is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B. All the stabbed cells survived for 24&#x000a0;h (results not shown), suggesting that the cells were not significantly damaged. Using a similar protocol, recombinant DsRed protein was also introduced into HeLa cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C, D). In this experiment, selective introduction into the cytosol was attempted. The tetrameric complex of DsRed was indeed distributed in the cytosol and not the nucleus of treated HeLa cells.

The culture medium was supplemented with 0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml plasmid DNA (pVenus-N1) encoding Venus (Nagai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2002</xref>), a bright version of yellow fluorescent protein. Cells were stabbed with the needle tip in their nuclei. To determine the percentage of cells transformed by pVenus-N1 DNA, cellular morphology and fluorescence were observed after 24&#x000a0;h by acquiring a DIC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E) and fluorescence image (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F). Similar experiments were repeated 11&#x000a0;times. Taking into account the increase in the number of cells due to cell division over 24&#x000a0;h, we determined that 75% of the stabbed cells had been transformed, and that no cells died from the cell surgery.</p><p>Differential transfection of targeted cells with two distinct plasmid DNA constructs is also possible. After some HeLa cells had been stabbed in the medium containing pVenus-N1 (0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml), the medium was replaced with that containing mRFP1 cDNA (mRFP1/pcDNA3, 0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml) and new cells were stabbed. After 24&#x000a0;h, two populations of HeLa cells with yellow or red fluorescence emerged (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>G, H). It is notable that the boundary between the two cell populations was clear. This differential transfection technique may be useful for studying the function of membrane-bound heterophilic molecules involved in cell adhesion or repulsion.</p><p>In order to demonstrate that stabbing with the NanoBlade does not cause significant cell damage, we attempted the CellBee technique on more fragile primary cells. Transfection of cultured hippocampal neurons with mRFP1 cDNA was performed (0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml mRFP1/pcDNA3 in the medium). Because primary neurons do not proliferate, it is relatively easy to identify stabbed neurons in images acquired 24&#x000a0;h post-transfection. Stabbed neurons are indicated by arrows in a DIC image (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). A fluorescence image shows that the same neurons emitted red fluorescence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). Furthermore, dual-color labeling of hippocampal neurons in a circuit is possible (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C, D). This technique results in extremely high viability of stabbed neurons (96%), compared with previous results using a conventional AFM cantilever (64%).

Such oblique needle positioning is disadvantageous for the following reasons: First, because the position of the pipette tip relative to a targeted cell is not regular, rapid delivery into numerous cells is hard to perform. Second, in the case of DNA transfection, in which a pipette tip must reach the nucleus, the Golgi apparatus next to the nucleus is often damaged. By contrast, the CellBee system described in this article uses a needle that is oriented and moved vertically. Thus, the <italic>x</italic>&#x02013;<italic>y</italic> position of the needle tip is always identifiable in PC or DIC images, and damage to the Golgi apparatus can be avoided. Furthermore, the CellBee technique does not monitor interactions between the needle tip and the plasma membrane of a targeted cell, thus simplifying the process. Instead, the needle pierces the cell or nucleus at a pre-set distance above the upper surface of the coverslip. In our experiments, delivery of chemicals or DNA into about 100 cells was achieved in a short period of time (&#x0003c;15&#x000a0;min) with high cell viability.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that single cell transfection was possible using AFM probes decorated with plasmid DNA (Cuerrier et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2007</xref>). Those studies extensively investigated the interaction between probes and cell membranes by measuring AFM force&#x02013;distance curves, and their transfection techniques were performed on relatively robust cells, such as HEK293 cells. In contrast, we propose here a device that makes the AFM-based molecular delivery technique more practical for cell biologists, using conventional light microscopy systems.</p><p>Another rapidly expanding technique for the introduction of macromolecules into single cells is photoporation. Targeted transfection by intense near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses is particularly appealing to many biologists (Tirlapur and K&#x00151;nig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>), but photoporation requires much experience and expertise, and the equipment is fairly expensive and large. While electroporation usually transfects an entire cell population, target cell electroporation has also been successfully performed (Hass et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2001</xref>; Olofsson et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2003</xref>). However, this technique does not permit transfection of a number of cells in a short period of time, or selective delivery into the cytoplasm or nucleus. The CellBee method we describe here uses a mechanical means of delivery, thereby permitting high spatiotemporal control. It has the advantage of simple and easy manipulation, as well as gentle treatment of fragile cell types, such as cultured neurons.</p><p>Cultured neurons make synapses with one another to establish functional circuits on a coverslip. Co-cultured glial cells (astrocytes) also actively participate in the development and maintenance of neuronal circuitry (Stevens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2003</xref>; Hama et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>). To analyze the roles of adhesive/repulsive and signaling molecules in synaptogenesis or synaptic plasticity in the context of circuit formation, it is necessary to transfect specifically targeted neurons or astrocytes with different plasmid DNA constructs and examine the effects on cell&#x02013;cell communication. Since cultured, post-mitotic neurons participating in a circuit cannot easily be replaced when damaged, it is also important to preserve transfected neurons. Our CellBee device is able to achieve both of these objectives, using a simple change of medium to transfect different plasmids and a nano-sized needle tip that permits high viability of transfected neurons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>HeLa cell preparation</title><p>HeLa cells were grown on the glass-bottom dish in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagles medium (DMEM, Sigma) containing 10% FBS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Neuron preparation</title><p>Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from Wistar rat fetuses (embryonic day 18&#x02013;20) and plated on a poly-<sc>l</sc>-Lysine coated glass-bottom dish in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM, Sigma) containing 2% FBS and N2 supplement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Plasmid DNA preparation</title><p>pVenus-N1, mRFP1/pcDNA3, and EGFP/pcDNA3 were amplified in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified using the endo-toxin free kit (QIAGEN).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>DsRed protein preparation</title><p>Recombinant DsRed protein fused to His-tag was produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified using the Ni-NTA agarose (Mizuno et&#x000a0;al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of needles were taken by Field-emission scanning electron microscopy FESEM (S-4700, Hitachi) in a 4000&#x000a0;times expand mode.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Construction of the CellBee device</title><p>The motor-controlled z-stage (LAS20-025-52S) was purchased from SMAC JAPAN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.smac-mca.co.jp/">http://www.smac-mca.co.jp/</ext-link>).
